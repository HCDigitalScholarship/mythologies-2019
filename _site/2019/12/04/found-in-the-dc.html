<p>Found in the Haverford [Dining] Center: a salad plate full of [spinach] with one round scoop of [chocolate] ice cream on top. It was sitting in front of a student who was holding a fork and chewing, presumably, a bite from the aforementioned plate. I, a spectator, was completely taken aback. What prompted this man to create such a [monstrosity]? Was I the only person in this crowded room who had noticed? Did the several people seated at his table know what he had done? If yes, did they approve?</p>

<p>There are infinite possible [explanations] for his motivation, but some are more likely than others. Maybe he lost a [bet] — a plausible [story], considering the demographic of the crowd at his table, who appear to be his <a href="weirdly enough, none of them seemed to question his [food]">friends</a>. Maybe he was the “funny friend” who wanted to entertain the same group. Maybe he’s simply trying to eat healthy, and the ice cream is his incentive to finish the greens.</p>

<p>There are also several possible [explanations] for his process of eating this meal. Maybe each bite contains both [spinach] and ice cream, to lessen the bitter taste of the latter. Considering the high ratio of [spinach] to ice cream, it is likely that the ice cream would be finished first and he would be left eating mostly dry [spinach]: an [unpleasant] method. Maybe he is smart and eats the [spinach] quickly so he can reward himself with the ice cream before it melts entirely. This consumption tactic seems like the smartest plan, and could be applicable for the second and third motivation theories.</p>

<p>I am choosing to not choose a [story]. I do not want to know the reasons behind the scene I witnessed because the truth is probably less fun than the stories my imagination can concoct.</p>
