    <h1>The Redundancy of Beauty</h1>

<p>Beauty, sunset, puppy, facebook, appeal, post, enjoy, redundancy, viewer, social media</p>

<p>Most of the human population that can see can recognize images that are inherently beautiful. Granted, everyone is unique and will see [beauty] in different places, but it is a widely accepted fact that [sunsets], small animals, the Aurora Borealis, and autumn leaves are beautiful. The list goes on. Every autumn, Instagram is filled with group photos of friends at a pumpkin patch; every time the afternoon sunlight is bent through the atmosphere at just the right angle, that [sunset] will show up on hundreds of Snapchat stories. When a family takes a trip to a tropical destination, photos of the beach will appear on [Facebook] and hordes of “wow, jealous!” comments will follow.</p>

<p>Eventually, these [post]s become repetitive. To any observer, they feel as if they’ve seen the same picture every time, and eventually the [appeal] may decrease and disappear. The need to take a picture of something beautiful is only as old as [photography] itself. We now have this desire to immediately capture and save the moment rather than [enjoy] it, even if everyone else has already done the same thing. With this mindset, we must rethink what [beauty] is. Are people taking these [sunset] pictures because they truly want to look at it every day, or because they want to prove to their friends that they saw and recognized [beauty] in the sky? Likely, the motivation stands with the former, but the chance that the photographer will look at and [enjoy] the picture again is low.</p>

<p>Someone who lives in the mountains may grow sick of the view but marvel at the expanse of ocean, and vice versa. Eventually, photography could turn into a similar ideal, and it is our job as the visual consumer to ensure we do not lose our ability to see [beauty] even if we’ve seen it before.</p>
