<p>My friends and I decided to watch [Us], the [Jordan Peele] movie that came out earlier this year. I have seen the movie two times prior, but two of my friends have not seen the move at all. It is fun to watch a film that you have seen before but your friends have not, because you can gauge their reactions and their theories about what is going to happen. I personally think [Jordan Peele] is changing how we view the [horror]-[psychological]-[thriller] [genre], especially when it comes to having Black folks on the screen. Also, I notice that his films are metaphors and allusions to our own reality.</p>

<p>The scene that I always stand out to me when I rewatched [Us] is when the tethered family and the “real” family are infront of each other in the living room. This is the first time in the movie where we see both families together in one space: the “[real]” family is being confronted by their [dopplegänger]. Although the tethered family are almost a mirrored version of them, they are quite different from the “[real]” family. They are the opposite of them in terms of personalities and strengths. For instance, [Zora], the “[real]” daughter, is your typical teenager that likes to listen to music and is also not that great of a runner despite being on the track team. [Zora]’s [teather], [Umbrae], is quite good at running. Essentially, the [doppleänger]s have similar passions as the “real” people in the film, but they are just better at it. But to go back to the scene, this is the first time they meet and of course the “[real]” family is confused as to who and why their [dopplegänger]s are in front of them. The “real” father asks them “Who are you?” and Red, who is the mom’s [dopplegänger], responds with “We’re [Americans]”. The first time I watched it, the whole theater gasped at this revelation. No one was expecting it. There is something about that line that grabs the audience’s attention. Obviously, my friends and I attempted to read every article that analyzes everything about the film and the different hidden messages behind Jordan’s
film and this is one of those lines that everyone wants to unpack, analyze, and understand.</p>

<p>I have my own theories about what “We’re [Americans]” can mean in relation to the film. For instance, it could be in references to how [Americans] from the United States treat others from marginalized communities. Part of the reason as to why the [dopplegängers] came above ground was to untether themselves from their “real” person. The [dopplegängers] live underground, separated from the rest of society, and forgotten. They were just an abandoned social experiment and now they want to live like everyone else. Basically, we see this in the United States and quite frankly everywhere else in the world with the various uprisings. Essentially, people will conform to the state until they had enough. In other words, people will only take so much until they reach their breaking point and mobilize. We have seen it in the past, we are now seeing it now, and we will continue to see this for the rest of time. When [Red] says “We’re [Americans]”, she is asserting and humanizing that the tethered also exist in this world, and they are not as different as the “real”. It is only so long they can live underground and forgotten about until they reach their breaking point and decide to fight for their freedom. In short, when people are ignored and forgotten about for an extended period of time, they will find a way to reclaim and insert their presence, and we see it in both the film and in real life.</p>
