<p>And Before You Ask, Yes, she was.</p>

<p>you’re in line at the grocery store</p>

<p>you check your phone to see the time</p>

<p>just to make sure you’re making good time for the bus</p>

<p>the wind blows your hair back slightly</p>

<p>you frisk it to see if it’s kept its shape</p>

<p>you notice out the corner of your eye that you’ve caught a woman’s attention</p>

<p>“why is she staring at me?” you wonder</p>

<p>you flash a polite smile and quickly look away, hoping she is satisfied with and ends this awkward experience</p>

<p>the line moves forward</p>

<p>you check your wallet and bank account app, making sure you have enough funds to</p>

<p>secure the groceries in your basket</p>

<p>the entrance sliding doors open once again, blowing your hair</p>

<p>the same woman has not released her gaze</p>

<p>it’s your turn in line</p>

<p>the employee kindly grabs your basket and begins to scan the items</p>

<p>you watch as the price goes up continuously, monitoring the transaction</p>

<p>the woman is now in front of you a register over</p>

<p>despite flashing another polite smile, her interest has not diminished</p>

<p>I LOVE YOUR HAIR she shouts.</p>

<p>you mutter thank y-</p>

<p>IS IT YOURS? IT’S YOURS RIGHT? she continues, her volume gaining the attention of shoppers around</p>

<p>you nod</p>

<p>I LOVE IT, IT’S SO BIG</p>

<p>you smile silently and direct your attention back to the employee</p>

<p>you apologize to them as you reach into your purse for your cash</p>

<p>you thank the employee before grabbing your bags and sitting near the exit to wait for your friends</p>

<p>you keep your head down and pull out your phone</p>

<p>a few minutes pass, your friends slowly making their way towards you</p>

<p>as you all leave, bags in hand, another woman approaches and smiles as she gets
closer</p>

<p>“I like your hair,,” she says</p>

<p>“Thank you,,” you respond as you pass each other</p>

<p>You and your friends begin to load the car</p>
