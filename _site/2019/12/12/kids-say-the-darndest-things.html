    <h1>Kids Say the Darndest Things</h1>
<h3>by Kymon Harrington</h3>
<div class='separator'></div>

<p>A while back, I was tasked with observing a class of children to see how they interact with one another at the young ages of 3-4, writing as many interactions as I could with the goal of going unnoticed. Spoiler alert, I failed, but the kids were pretty interesting. Because they are obviously minors, all of their cute little names have been pseudonymized.</p>

<p><em>NOTES BEGIN</em></p>

<p>I immediately take a seat in the corner where there are no children present.</p>

<p>Karla comes behind my chair, ignores me and sets up a pet shop: “Pet shop everyone!”</p>

<p>No one answers.</p>

<p>4 girls are playing with each other whispering by the play kitchen across the room. They are pretending to make food.</p>

<p>Group of 4 boys recognize and build shape forms with legos</p>

<p>Girls are still playing house</p>

<p>Children like to be recognized- Karla shouts 3 more times “who wants a pet from the pet shop?!”</p>

<p>Teacher says “I would love a pet from the pet shop”</p>

<p>Four girls run over to Karla and take pets.</p>

<p>The boys are beginning to chant “we chop kittens”</p>

<p>This goes on for five more minutes</p>

<p>Karla says “I want to keep the dog because Sophie kept a dog”</p>

<p>Girls say “excuse me and please” when handing each other pets</p>

<p>They are told it is time to clean.</p>

<p>I feel like someone is touching me</p>

<p>I turn around and Karla is playing in my hair. She smiled at me when we made eye contact.</p>

<p>I try to ignore it but she is still fondling in my locs.</p>

<p>I stand up and turn in a circle. As I sit back down, there are three more little girls playing in my hair</p>

<p>“I like your hair!” Followed by a bunch of “yea it’s so pretty”</p>

<p>I say thank you and get up and walk away, moving into the snack room.</p>

<p>All the children sit. There is one boy at and all girls table and one girl at an all boys table.</p>

<p>Another table fills with the same girls that touched my hair.</p>

<p>Everyone waits patiently for their snack.</p>

<p>Everyone eats and talks with one another</p>

<p>The two outsiders are in an easy conversation with the opposite sex</p>

<p>Everyone starts getting ready to go outside.</p>

<p>“Boobies isn’t a bathroom word! My mommy has boobies!”</p>

<p>It is time to leave out the door</p>
