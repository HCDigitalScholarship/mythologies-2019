    <h1>Boba vs. Bubble Tea</h1>
<h3>by Alexandra Iglesia</h3>
<div class='separator'></div>

<p>The Taiwanese-originated boba, or bubble tea has become an icon for young
Asian-Americans. Flavoring of the liquid part of the beverage can range from fruity tastes such
as lychee, passionfruit, or mango, to creamy milk teas such as taro, matcha or thai tea. Essential
to the drink is not the tea itself but rather the “boba” or “bubbles”, i.e. the chewy tapioca balls
which rest at the bottom, waiting to be slurped up the girthy straw by its consumer. Further, the
temperature of the drink is offered as a binary; most commonly it is served cold on ice as a
summer-friendly beverage, but also it can be a complement to the brisk winter nights as hot
libation. Therefore, the tenderness of the tapioca balls can vary in accordance to the temperature
of the serving. Many consumers have noted that temperature is not the only variable in the
softness of the tapioca balls but also the maker of the drink, for example, large corporation
boba/bubble tea chains such as Kung Fu Tea versus small businesses such as Yi’s Boba located
in Ardmore, Pennsylvania. Indeed, this has raised much debate about which source is better for
boba/bubble tea lovers. However, most discourse of the drink arises in the name of it: is it bubble
tea or simply boba?</p>

<p>If one is to ask an Asian-American of Generation Z the name of the beverage, there is a
chance they will say “boba” or “bubble tea” depending on which coast they come from. “Boba”,
used as the lexical of West Coast drinkers, would be questioned if ordered in New York or
Miami stores, where “bubble tea” prevails. Despite both names referring to the same
sacchariferous drink filled with chewy orbs, the ongoing rivalry between East Coast and West
Coast Asian-Americans holds up the altercation.
Boba/bubble tea can be found in the similar form and/or packaging, but is assorted with
different colors. Sipping the beverage is thus an all sensory experience as its aesthetic captures
the sight of the consumer while its taste, texture and name raise much conversation. It can be
argued that the beverage is merely a fad of today’s society, however, chains such as Kung Fu
Tea release smartphone applications, flavors of the month, and promotions to retain their
revenue. Moreover, the beverage has received much backlash as buzz terms such as “boba</p>

<p>liberalism” trend on social media. Nonetheless, the beverage itself stands as pleasurable and as a
symbol for social interaction.</p>
