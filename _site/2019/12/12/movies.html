    <h1>The Movies</h1>
<h3>by Julia Coletti</h3>
<div class='separator'></div>

<p>Cinema has always been a site of contention: between image and [real]ity, universality and particularity, and between art and industry. Throughout its relatively short history it has played a monumental role in shaping modern culture, the stories it tells (as well as the ones it leaves out), both reflect and influence the way people act, dress, dream, think, and see. Regardless of whether you love watching movies, or would prefer to spend your time otherwise, it is impossible to dismiss the cultural relevance of film.</p>

<p>Nowadays, there are more movies than ever, and they are available at our fingertips without even going to a theater. [streaming] services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, HBO, and Hulu are putting out shows and films faster than one can keep up with. [streaming] services are marking a new era in [user] experience; one that some read as the death of cinema.</p>

<p>Gone are the days where you would have to venture out to the theater to see the latest hit. While theaters still exist and many people still go, the nature of cinema has drastically changed. What has occurred has been almost a complete cooptation of the cinematic form for capitalistic industry over an art form. This is not to argue whether the latest star-studded action flick could be seen as a work of art, but rather that the latest excess of content is being monopolized by large corporations and put out at a rate greater than one we’ve ever seen before.</p>

<p>On the other hand, as an increasing number of shows and movies are being made, there is greater opportunity increased diversity of representation and form, meaning content to meet anyone’s interest. (Although the efficacy and [real]ity of this point could also be debated to a great extent).</p>

<p>Another way that [streaming] has shifted the cinematic form is simply in the means in which we watch movies. Once an experience shared by many, sitting in the dark in front of a big [screen], sometimes gasping as a chorus, sometimes laughing out of turn. The experience has always been somewhat anonymous and singular, but there was a sense of collectivity.</p>
