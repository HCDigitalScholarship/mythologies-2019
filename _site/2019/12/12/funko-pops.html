<p>Funko Pops! Little [plastic] [figures]. Meant to be well, pretty much anything you can imagine. But they aren’t really special. I mean sure, they are [cute], but they all seem the same. They all have the same mouthless faces with a little nose and black dots for eyes. Sure there are some unique characteristics like the [character]’s clothes or hair, but at first glance they seem pretty [copy paste]. so let’s take a closer look.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at Zach, Jason and Trini. at first the only big difference seems to be the hair, clothes and skin tone between the three. Looking at the faces all three have different shaped eyebrows and Trini being female has [eyelashes] while the other two don’t. The chest [size] is also different excluding Trini, Jason seems to have a larger chest than Zach. Also, I thought Zach only appear taller due to his hair but I see now that their eyes are different levels. Jason and Zach seemed to have similar hand sizes while Trini’s is a lot smaller. female Funko Pops also tend to have smaller feet. So clearly, Funko Pops aren’t as identical as we all thought it begs the question, however,  how are certain Funko Pops created based on a character’s [race] and [gender]?</p>
