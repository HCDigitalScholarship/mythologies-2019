<p>As a huge [nerd], I was, and honestly still am a [fan] of the Power Rangers. I didn’t grow up with “Mighty Morphin Power Rangers” Like most people twice my age, but I certainly watched it. Due to my love of Power Rangers, I was recently recommended a [YouTube] [video] [series], by YouTube, that had to do with the Power Rangers.</p>

<p>This series was made by fans and stars fans playing the [characters]. the [outfits] in this series are different from the [original], Though the helmets are similar.  the characters to have some differences. For example, in the fan version, the Green Ranger is female, and is still in a relationship with the pink ranger who is gay.</p>

<p>I bring this up because of Enwezor’s “Archive Fever.” In it he discusses an image being altered by a different artist from the original.  But Enwezor mentions that the artist interacts with the [archive] of the original, not the original itself. I think this applies to my example. Power Rangers is old so at some point it must have entered some part of the archive. So this fan series on YouTube is it interacting with the archive of Power Rangers and not the original? Does it change the [body]’s represented in the original version by making changes to the characters?</p>
