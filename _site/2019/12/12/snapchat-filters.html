    <h1>Snapchat Filters</h1>
<h3>by Delia McHale</h3>

<p>Snapchat filters, pretty, silly, ugly, feminization, eyelashes, plastic surgery, Peyton Manning, Nationwide, distorted, bobblehead, smooth, Snapchat, idealized, feminine, sexy, gaze, selfie, gender, virtual</p>

<p>Snapchat filters tend to fall into one of two categories. There are silly filters, and there are pretty filters. Some people might disagree, citing the existence of sponsored filters or sports team filters. However, both of these subcategories are always either silly or pretty and only reinforce the silly/pretty dichotomy.</p>

<p>Silly filters are fairly straightforward. They either distort your face for comedic effect, put your face on top of an object or animal, or put the face of an object or animal on top of yours. Some of them will produce even more hilarity in the form a short animation when you open your mouth or blink your eyes. Unfortunately for those who prefer silly filters, their existence is overshadowed by their flashier sibling, the pretty filter.</p>

<p>On any given day it would appear that about 75% of the rotating Snapchat filters fall under the pretty umbrella. Lucky for us, the pretty filters are much more interesting than the silly filters. The underlying template is always the same; it smooths out your skin, makes your eyes, eyelashes, and lips larger, and it makes your nose and chin smaller. Using a pretty filter is a great way to find out how you would look if a plastic surgeon decided to make you beautiful. However, the best part by far is that every single filter that isn’t silly will make you prettier. No matter what else it does. The snowy filter, which makes it look like you’re sitting in front of a window on a snowy day, makes you pretty. The infamous dog filter, a pioneer of the pretty filter genre, boldy gave you both dog ears and dark eyelashes. A filter which put your face on a Nationwide bobblehead next to football superstar Peyton Manning and country singer Brad Paisley inexplicably made you prettier. Neutral filters cannot exists.</p>

<p>One possible exception to the pretty/silly filter system has been left out. Two filters, one which aims to transform women’s faces into men’s faces, and the other which does the reverse, exist in a sort of grey area. Are they silly? Are they supposed to be informative? The man to woman filter can be accounted for, as it more or less does the same thing as the pretty filters. But the woman to man filter has no peers. There is no other filter offered by Snapchat which masculinizes rather than feminizes. Even the moustache filter is just a moustache put on top of a pretty filter. Writing the woman to man filter off as silly would seem to diminish it. After you’ve scrolled through the entire list of available filters, the woman to man filter is the last stop. You are stuck, suddenly, staring at pale eyelashes and a square jaw covered in a five o’clock shadow. How are you supposed to feel now.</p>
