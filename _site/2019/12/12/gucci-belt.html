<p>The Gucci belt cannot be missed. In fact, it’s only identifying feature is two large, overlapping, metallic Gs; the Gucci logo. It’s not exactly ugly or pretty, it just is. Because of its sparse and iconic design, it is immediately visible in photos. The belt was originally released in 1962 and has experienced a sort of renaissance in the past couple of years. While it can often be seen in candid photos of celebrities, its true home is Instagram. Here the belt is no longer reserved for the rich and famous but has been co-opted by the locals. Notably, the most basic version of the belt currently retails for $460. Certainly expensive, but not quite out of reach for many in the middle class.</p>

<p>The design, implicit celebrity endorsement, and price point of the Gucci belt make it the ideal candidate for Instagram fame. It doesn’t really matter what it actually looks like, what matters is the multitude of other pictures of the belt that the viewer immediately remembers every time they see it. They know that if or when they buy it, these same images with pop up in the heads of their friends and followers. It is a way to make a clear choice about who other people associate you with.</p>
