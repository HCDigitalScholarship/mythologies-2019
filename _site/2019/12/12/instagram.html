    <h1>Instagram</h1>
<h3>by Julia Coletti</h3>
<div class='separator'></div>

<p>Instagram can best be described  as a clusterfuck of images, an ongoing feed of images to scroll through, ranging from selfies, to news, to advertisements and much beyond and in between. Although the content you receive is largely dependent upon its [user], as a result of choices of what accounts to follow and who the algorithm has determined you are and what you are likely to buy, many people have a shared experience of annoyance, escapism, procrastination, and addiction.</p>

<p>Walking into Haverford’s library, you are sure to find at least a handful of people with their faces down, thumbs revolving, mindlessly scrolling through slews of pictures. There is no other logical form of categorization in which you’d see a selfie from a high school acquaintance fallen prey to the latest pyramid scheme captioned with a pseudo-inspirational quote about how “you too can stop being broke if you just work from your phone!” next to a picture of the world burning down and demands to take action (which often just equates further circulation of images until our collective attention span moves on, putting the world on the back burner to get a nice thick char).</p>

<p>This is not to chastise the social media fiend, for I’m bound to find myself scrolling through my phone at least twice before this piece is written, but to question the way in which its fundamentally transformed our modes of interaction and consumption. It’s no secret that we feel compelled to share every aspect of our lives, screaming into the void for some form of validation and connection in rooms full of people looking at their phones instead of each other (ourselves included). But it would be too oversimplified to blame our social disconnection on generational apathy and self-[obsession]. Not even addressing the capitalist commodification of social interactions and experience, generating new perversions of social capital, platforms for sale, and the collection and use of personal data.</p>

<p>But more generally, the visual and informatic format of Instagram (and similar social media platforms), while increasing our capacity to share and stay attuned to the happenings of the world and of your aunt’s dog, also serve to further embed [technology] within our social experience, blurring the boundary between body and [technology].</p>
