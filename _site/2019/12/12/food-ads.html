    <h1>On Food Ads</h1>
<h3>by Juliana Brinn</h3>
<div class='separator'></div>

<p>-Food, ads, product, consumer, Instagram, craving, IHOP, companies, dressing up, food pics,</p>

<p>A while ago, there was a video circulating around about the truth behind [food] advertising. In order to make food more appealing in [ads], [companies] did things like add cardboard circles between pancakes stacks and use motor oil instead of syrup. But, then you contrast that with people posting pictures of their food on [Instagram]. Unlike in ads, the Instagram [pics] are fully edible because you didn’t pour motor oil over them. Yet, in theory, the Instagram photos should look worse than the ad, right? That’s why companies put so much money into [dressing up] the food. But then again, I don’t think anybody really notices or cares anyway. There should be a huge distinction between how ads look and how instafood pics look, but no one seems to make a big deal about it. even when you go to a restaurant, like let’s say you order pancakes at [IHOP]. You aren’t going to be disappointed that it doesn’t look like the billboard outside. And of course it shouldn’t be different because you won’t have cardboard in your pancakes or motor oil since a restaurant can serve that to you. Visually, the food, the real food, not the ad, should still look tasty to you. So why try to make the ad look different from the real thing?</p>
