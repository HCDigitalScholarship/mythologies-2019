<p>“No update will every beat iOS 6 to iOS 7” proclaims the anonymous author of a 2017 reddit post.1 They’re referring to Apple’s much anticipated iPhone user interface (UI) overhaul, introduced in 2013 with the release of iOS 7. An image attached below contains two screenshots; the default iPhone home screen created for iOS 6 sits next to the iOS 7 analog, demanding comparison. The differences between the two are immediately clear. iOS 7 has completely done away with the shadows and highlights used in iOS 6 to create the illusion of depth. Additionally, while many app icons in iOS 6 emulate the appearance of the “real world” object they intend to replace, apps in iOS 7 have adopted a minimalist approach and merely suggest their material counterparts of yore.
iOS 7 is a prime example of a style known as flat design. Flat design, which is most generally considered to consist of shadowless, depthless, and simplified shapes, is the undisputed king of modern UIs. Before its reign, many UIs had aimed to digitally recreate the three dimensional world. This style, known as skeuomorphism, is present in the shadows of the first five Google logos, in the detailed instant camera of the original Instagram icon, all over iOS 6, and in nearly every other UI of the aughts. But design trends are doomed to end, and in the early 2010s flat design began its takeover. In 2011, Snapchat debuted on Apple’s App Store using a skeuomorphic icon containing drop shadows and a highlight that suggested a bubble-esque shape. Within the year, the icon was redesigned to feature a solid yellow background. Its iconic ghost, which originally had eyes and a mouth, was replaced with a plain white ghost shape outlined in black. In 2013, the same year iOS 7 was released, the shadows on the Google logo disappeared and the Facebook app icon’s rounded blue background was replaced by a hard blue block. In 2016, Instagram ditched the instant camera icon in favor of simple white lines over a soft, yet flat, pink and yellow gradient. Netflix, Microsoft, Adobe, and Yahoo! all took the plunge. It would be impossible to name every internet based company which “went flat” in the past ten years, so for simplicity’s sake we’ll just say it was all of them.</p>

<p>Much debate has gone into the merits and demerits of flat design. Rather than discussing whether flat design is “good” or “bad”, which is almost always a matter of personal taste, it is more interesting to ask why so many multibillion and even trillion dollar companies would choose to use it as their public “face”. It is generally thought that, initially, skeuomorphic UIs were required to guide the user through the cold and unfamiliar technological environment. Visual replications of objects they already recognized, such as an instant camera, could provide a bridge between their past experiences and the novel task of taking pictures with their iPhone. However, over time, the average user lost their technological naivete. At last designers were free from the shackles of drop shadows. Flat design was billed as an improvement over skeuomorphism as it stripped the UI of all but its most essential features. Additionally, its simplicity was said to create a better user experience (UX), as the users were now free to focus on content rather than on the interface behind it.</p>

<p>Over the past ten years, big tech has undergone a larger, more structural shift. We sat and watched while platform after platform grew their reach far past their original function. In 2014, Snapchat introduced “Live Stories”. It was an extension of their story feature, which allows users to post photos and videos that would be visible to anyone who had added them on the app, and would disappear after 24 hours. Live Stories, on the other hand, were stories crowdsourced from attendees of trendy events around the world. The Live Stories were added to the same page that had previously been reserved exclusively for the original, more personal, stories. It was around this time that Snapchat first began posting third party advertisements. A year later, Snapchat expanded even further and added a “Discover” section, which contained stories created by various media outlets. In the years from 2013 to 2018, Instagram, which was acquired by Facebook in 2012, went from being a platform for posting singular, static images, to one which featured albums, photo editing, live streams, direct messaging, and a story feature of their own. As of 2019, Apple, Amazon, Snapchat, Facebook, Youtube, and even Tinder, a dating app, produce and promote their own video content. Apple, Amazon, and Google have all introduced music streaming services. The past decade saw a handful of companies expand exponentially in an endless pursuit of acquiring all of the user’s time, money, and attention.</p>

<p>The standard explanation for flat design’s dominance seemingly accounts for the concurrence of its widespread adoption and the rise of internet based megacorporations. As the companies and UIs we know so well matured, the simpler interface provided by flat UIs was easier to implement across multiple platforms. Additionally, a minimalist approach would give the make the companies seem more sophisticated and professional as they branched out into new industries. Finally, it would highlight their impressive array of content while simultaneously improving the UX. While these points are certainly valid, a central part of flat design’s function is missing from this analysis.</p>

<p>Across multiple platforms flat UIs tend to have a consistent color palette. It consists primarily of simple happy colors somewhere between pastel and neon. They typically lean towards the latter. Notably, it bears a fairly close resemblance to what the modern American might associate with a kindergarten classroom. These colors, which are particularly visible in the Google logo, lend many platforms a much needed air of playful innocence. A database of unprecedented power would be black with blinking lights and cold metal edges, not a happy rainbow. Further, flat UIs often serve to separate the content from the content provider. Take, for example, an advertisement for Domino’s on Instagram. The ad would appear as a Domino’s post in the user’s feed, sandwiched between posts from accounts the user actually follows. At this level, the idea that Instagram had nothing to do with the ad is already being reinforced. Much as nobody would think Instagram posted their friend’s dog photos for them, the location of the ad and the “Domino’s” username above it signal to the user that Domino’s was responsible for the post. The only indication that the post is in fact an advertisement is a small “Sponsored” sitting underneath the username. On the screen, the pizza close-up is surrounded by Instagram’s white background and a few simple icons that invite you to like, comment, or share, as is the case for every post. The contrast is incredibly stark; a greasy, bright, and unwanted image against a clean and familiar UI. Instagram has milled through your data to determine what you’re most likely to purchase, inserted it into a stream of images you think you’ve chosen to see, and gotten paid to do so. And yet the ad is still most strongly associated with Domino’s. While flat design has highlighted the ad, it has simultaneously minimized the platform’s hand in its creation.</p>

<p>As digital media platforms became more and more advertisement saturated, skeuomorphism became undesirable. Not only did it look outdated as soon as Apple ditched it, it bled into the constant stream of images flickering across our screens. Many previously ad-free platforms slowly slipped in sponsored content in between updating their UI and introducing new features. Suddenly, images and videos seemed to pop up at random. At this point, even the unsponsored content became overwhelming. Picture after picture after video after notification was thrown at the user. By emulating reality, skeuomorphic UI blended the visual experience of seeing yet another Snapchat story with seeing your iPhone’s home screen. Flat design allowed the UI, and in extension the platform itself, to become an oasis. You hit the home button and suddenly, silence. A sense of calm. The platform wasn’t the source of your content fatigue, it was an escape from it.</p>

<p>Calling flat design a tool used to help simplify the virtual experience for the user ignores the fact that platforms are now more complicated than ever before. The introduction of flat design immediately before online media exploded was not an accident. In a period where companies such as Apple, Google, and Facebook decided to increase the amount of information they fed the user, flat UIs allowed them to highlight content that they specifically chose to promote. While the companies are obviously being paid, it seems worthwhile to emphasize that every advertisement and aspect of their platform is under their control. Nothing they do is an accident.</p>

<p>However, there is a sense of cognitive dissonance when we realize we dislike what a platform does while having a positive impression of the company behind it. Apple products are sleek, refined, and modern, but every update is the same thing at a higher price. How many people do you know who would agree with this but still own an iPhone? I do. The design of these platforms is very easy to overlook. It’s bright and happy and reminds us of the future. It is morally, or aesthetically, above the algorithms and advertisements we’re forced to wade through when we travel from one post to the next. Flat design has helped separate the company from its actions in the mind of the user by constructing a friendly and inherently digital environment. When we are presented with yet another targeted advertisement, it does not come in the red, blue, yellow and green letters of the Google logo. It is most often a picture from the physical world, relegated to its own corner of the screen, outlined and offset in the corner.</p>
