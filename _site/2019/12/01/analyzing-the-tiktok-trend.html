    <h1>Analyzing the TikTok Trend</h1>
<h3>by Becca Matson</h3>
<div class='separator'></div>

<p>#TikTok, #socialnetworkingapp, #relatablecontent, #Instagram, #scrolling, #trends, #ForYoupage, #24/7, #YouTube, #TV, #attentionspan, #internet, #ADHD, #focus, #bored, #highschool, #socialmedia, #algorithm, #user, #Netflix, #post, #movie, #smartphones</p>

<p>[TikTok] is a relatively new [social networking app] that allows users to post videos from 15 seconds in length up to 60 seconds in length. The most popular form of [TikTok]s include lip-syncing to a particular audio clip of a song or someone’s voice and inserting your own text on the screen to accompany the song’s lyrics or message.</p>

<p>[TikTok] differs from [Instagram] in the sense that it is less about “looking perfect” and more so about creating funny and [relatable content]. This content applies to a wide range of people— from [highschool]ers making videos about their parents, to college kids about their stress studying for finals, to doctors posting tips and tricks about how to get into medical school. These videos are mainly made to make viewers laugh, relate, and then keep [scrolling].</p>

<p>The [“For You” page] showcases all of the [TikTock]s that the majority of people are currently liking and viewing. However, this page is tailored to fit the [user]’s interests. When I first downloaded the [app] and had not liked any videos yet, I got a wide variety of content on my [“For You” page]. As I began to like videos and search things, the app’s [algorithm] tailored the [“For You” page] to my personal interests based on my liked videos, and I began to see videos similar to the ones I had previously searched and liked. This personalized [algorithm] is similar to [Instagram]’s [algorithm], which places the people’s pages who you view the most at the top of your feed when they [post].</p>

<p>In addition, the super short lengths of these videos indicates how [user]s’ [attention spans] are slowly shortening due to the massive amounts of data and information available to them through the [internet] [24/7]. Video lengths have progressively gone from 2 hour movies, to an hour or 30 minute [TV] shows, to 10-5 minute YouTube videos, and now to only a few seconds of video footage through the [TikTok] [app]. [TikTok]’s short video lengths allow for its content to be easily digestible and accessible. Since the [app] is free, users have millions of videos instantly at their fingertips, which differs from having to pay for a [movie] or a [Netflix] subscription. Now, when watching a longer [TV] show, many people reach for their [smartphone] when the show’s pace slows down and they begin to lose focus. We are no longer able to concentrate and pay direct [attention] to one thing for an extended amount of time, since we are constantly being bombarded with data and [image]s through the [internet] and [social media]. Instead, these short [TikTok]s have become a massive trend which aligns with our ever-increasingly short [attention span]s.</p>

<p>More people are beginning to use [TikTok] since it diverges from [Instagram]’s need to look “perfect” all the time. Instead, [TikTok] is simply about producing funny and [relatable content] for everyone to laugh at, enjoy, and send to their friends.</p>
