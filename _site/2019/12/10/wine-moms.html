<p>A relatively new cultural phenomenon is the “[wine] [mom]:” an exhausted mother, who after a long day of child-rearing likes to sit down and relax with a huge glass of [wine]. Some people call these women “[lazy]” as they actively flaunt their relaxation despite the children they so obviously have to care for, but most are appreciative of this lifestyle. This phenomenon has even gone so far as to cease to apply solely to mothers: now any [woman], or man for that matter, getting [wine]-drunk while sinking into the couch can be considered a “[wine] [mom].”</p>

<p>Being a “[wine] [mom]” is an interesting topic of discussion when one considers John Berger’s book <em>Ways of Seeing</em>, in which Berger discusses the subjective applications of sight: the creator’s [perspective] always shines through in their works (and in [ideology]) and is filtered through our (the [viewer’s]) own [understandings] of history and [society] (and we must somehow “unfilter” these notions)[^9]. The creator, in this case, is the “[wine] [mom].” I wonder what this means for our applications of our own [understandings]? If laziness has become somewhat naturalized as a desirable thing through the concept of a “[wine] [mom],” when in the past our [understandings] have led us to believe the opposite, this certainly belies some aspects of our [culture].</p>

<p>[American] [culture] has been centered around the “[American] Dream” which, in turn, was centered on unrelenting hardwork and determination. Today, I think it is safe to say we have taken this hardworking mentality to an [extreme], which can be witnessed in the rise of [mental] [health] issues due to high levels of stress and [extreme] [workloads]. Now, some creators have proliferated an [image] of laziness and of excessive “kicking back.” Through our own [understanding], we should reject this [image]. Yet, as we unfilter our preconceived notions, there is truth behind the “laziness:” a call to [fix] the [culture] that so effortlessly dominates the minds and bodies of [Americans], pushing them to [extremes] and refusing to let them become a “[wine] [mom]” for even a moment.</p>
