Like always I was scrolling through my Twitter feed and since it was Halloween, a good portion of my content was Halloween related. As I scrolled, I saw a tweet that was mentioning [Megan Thee Stallion]’s short filmed [*Hottieween*]. At first, I did not know what they were talking about and was immediately intrigued. [Megan Thee Stallion] made a short film?! Why was I not informed about this? I knew right away that I had to watch it. Only the first two parts were available and the third part was going to come out later that evening. As impatient as I am, I watched the first two parts and left myself on a cliffhanger.

The first part opens up and situates the characters. The viewer is immediately aware that there is a group of men, who are vampires, going around attacking women. Then, there is [Megan Thee Stallion], who plays the [private investigator], and she has an assistant. Obviously, [Megan Thee Stallion] and her assistant are the only ones who are concerned about what is terrorizing the neighborhood and attacking young women (of course, the police are dumbfounded about the mysterious deaths). Basically, this is your typical horror movie set up of plot and characters.

The first part sets up what is happening in the neighborhood, but we also see [Megan Thee Stallion]’s character in her element, until a man shows up. The man, who is played by [Dave Eas]t (a rapper from [Harlem]) captures her attention, but little does she know that he is one of the [vampires] that are going around. Basically, she gets bit by him, and she becomes a [vampire] herself! Instead of sulking about it when she finds out the next morning, she uses it for advantage. With her newly founded powers, she goes around protecting women from the vampire men who are tormenting the city. I will not spoil the end for you, because I have yet to watch it. I suspect that the ending will involve her getting revenge on the man who had turned her.

My favorite part about [*Hottieween*] is that it is just simply fun. There is nothing at stake and it is just a low-key horror short film for Halloween. It has an all Black cast and is directed by [Teyana Taylor], who is a singer from [Harlem]. There is an upsurge of horror films that are being created and reclaiming the Black characters. The history of Black characters in [horror] films has not been a good one. They are usually the first killed off, or they just simply do not exist in that reality. However, that is quite rapidly changing. We see that in [Jordan Peele]’s [Get Out] and [Us]. Also, [Ma] which came out earlier this year starting with [Octavia Spencer] (As an FYI, I have not seen this film yet but from the trailers that I remember seeing earlier this year the main villain is a Black character. But once again, I don't really know if she is a villain or not).  Anyways, whether Hollywood cares about [representation], we are finally seen characters who are Black and are not being killed first. Although, [*Hottieween*] is not a feature length film and whatnot, it is still important for [representation]. It is necessary to have films with representation, despite if it is a serious or fun film, no matter what length is,  and what  platform it is streamed on.

Can not wait to see how it ends!
