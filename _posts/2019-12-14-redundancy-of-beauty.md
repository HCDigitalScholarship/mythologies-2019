Most of the human population that can see can recognize images that are inherently beautiful. Granted, everyone is unique and will see [beauty] in different places, but it is a widely accepted fact that [sunsets], small animals, the Aurora Borealis, and autumn leaves are beautiful. The list goes on. Every autumn, Instagram is filled with group photos of friends at a pumpkin patch; every time the afternoon sunlight is bent through the atmosphere at just the right angle, that [sunset] will show up on hundreds of Snapchat stories. When a family takes a trip to a tropical destination, photos of the beach will appear on [Facebook] and hordes of “wow, jealous!” comments will follow.

Eventually, these [post]s become repetitive. To any observer, they feel as if they’ve seen the same picture every time, and eventually the [appeal] may decrease and disappear. The need to take a picture of something beautiful is only as old as [photography] itself. We now have this desire to immediately capture and save the moment rather than [enjoy] it, even if everyone else has already done the same thing. With this mindset, we must rethink what [beauty] is. Are people taking these [sunset] pictures because they truly want to look at it every day, or because they want to prove to their friends that they saw and recognized [beauty] in the sky? Likely, the motivation stands with the former, but the chance that the photographer will look at and [enjoy] the picture again is low.

Someone who lives in the mountains may grow sick of the view but marvel at the expanse of ocean, and vice versa. Eventually, photography could turn into a similar ideal, and it is our job as the visual consumer to ensure we do not lose our ability to see [beauty] even if we’ve seen it before.
