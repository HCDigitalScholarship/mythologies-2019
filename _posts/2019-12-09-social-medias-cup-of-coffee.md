In post-[internet] visual [culture], “[coffee] pics” have run rampant throughout social media. For me, it’s almost impossible not to encounter someone’s picture of their morning latte art, and it’s become naturalized to view these [images] of [coffee] as “basic” or something reserved for girls with high-quality cameras. Personally, these [coffee]-posters have become the butt-end of plenty of jokes within my group of [friends]. On the other hand, I wonder why someone would [post] a picture of their [coffee] if not for [enjoyment] or to innocently share a piece of their life?

So, why does much of [society] judge others for [posting] something that gives them pleasure?

This line of questioning, I believe, stems from our conceptualization of visual [culture] today and how it has changed with [reproduction][^8]. The modern proliferation of [digital] [images] is indicative of the changing values of our [culture], in that modern societies more greatly desire [accessibility] and [inclusion], and reproduced [images] are more accessible and therefore more inclusive (since more people can view them). This seems like a fantastic thing―more people being able to participate in a previously [exclusive] visual [society] reserved for the upper [class] seems ideal. But, when people are judged and harassed for their choice of image-sharing, what does this say about the future of our visual [culture]? Perhaps this visual harassment is, in some sense, a good thing? Maybe it will reduce the great number of [coffee] pictures on social media. Or perhaps our visual [culture] will slowly become more [exclusive] and revert back to the [traditional] format, banning [coffee]-picture-takers and the like from the visual-media-sharing [environment] in the same sense lower [class] people were excluded from past artistic [culture]. Or maybe it will become like a toxic [video] game [environment] with people slandering and cursing others for their sharing choices. I think it’s important to keep in mind that history can repeat itself―I believe it is entirely possible for our [culture] to exclude groups again, and [coffee] pictures can serve as a reminder to [society] to be more accepting of others in visual [culture].
