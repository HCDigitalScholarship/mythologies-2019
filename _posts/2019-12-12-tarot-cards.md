Recently, my friends and I wanted to find a new hobby and decided on that we should learn how to read [tarot cards]. I have some knowledge about [tarot cards], and the one thing I do know is that when picking out a deck of [tarot cards] you have to find the one that speaks to you. Ideally, it does make sense that you have to pick a deck that you have a connection with since you will need to interpret them to find the message behind the cards that have been selected. With all of that being said, I spent hours searching and deliberating which decks spoke to me.

As I was scrolling, I kept noticing how different each deck was from each other. Some decks were simple, some were colorful, and others just had a lot of designs. I ended up choosing the Golden Thread Tarot Deck designed by Tina Gong. The deck is quite [minimalist], black background with [gold]en lining around the cards. Two of the cards from the deck that stood out to me were [the empress] and the [high priestess]. Both are beautifully drawn and contain elegant gold details. Out all of them, The [high priestess] card is my favorite. The [high priestess] is in between two pillars; both the dress and pillars are adorned with eyes at the bottom. In her left hand, the high priestess if holding an open book and in her right hand, there is a levitating stone. The deck comes with a small guide that gives brief details about what each card means and how it changes if the card is reversed or not. For instance, when the [high priestess] is upright, it could mean either intuition, unconscious, and inner voice; while it is reversed it could mean lack of center, lost of inner voice, and repressed feelings. When [the empress] is upright it means motherhood, fertility, and nature and while it is reversed it means dependence, smothering, and coldness. Of course, I personally would not have gotten that just based on the image alone but it is interesting how these images are supposed to convey that.

I find it interesting to think about how each deck is created with the designersâ€™ own interpretation and style. They make their own creative decisions about how they want the deck to look based on their own personal aesthetic. The type of cards in the deck never changes; in other words, each standard deck of cards will have 78-79 cards that include the [Major Arcana], [Wands], [Cups], [Swords], and [Pentacles], but the designers interpret those categories their own way and then translate them onto the cards. Subsequently, people look for a deck that speaks to them and buys that one. Now, those people have to either learn how to interpret [tarot cards] or take their prior knowledge of reading the deck in order to interpret their new deck. Meaning no one will read the same deck the same way as another person because an image may speak one way to one person and it may speak differently to another person.

I cannot help but think about how tarot cards have been aestheticized while being deeply personalized to whoever is reading the deck. I thought about the decks that I was looking at and which ones I wanted and why did I want them? Was it because they were pretty? [Simple]? Different from the others that one I kept seeing? Maybe it was all of that and I just went with the one that I knew I could learn from first. I will admit that I now have a tarot card folder on my browser just in case I am in the mood to by another card that speaks to me.
