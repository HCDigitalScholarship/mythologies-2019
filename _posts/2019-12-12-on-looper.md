Today I watched the [movie] “Looper.”  It came out in 2012, so naturally I was watching at home, not in theaters.  So how does the atmosphere affect my consumption of the [film]? Well for one, there are a lot more [distractions] at home.  I actually spent the first 20 minutes of the movie eating lunch, so I didn’t pay attention to the beginning.  This is difficult because the movie relied so much on visual cues.  Movies combine two forms of media: visual and auditory. But movies don't really need sound that's why [silent] movies were and in some ways continue to be an aspect of modern pop culture. Movies only really need visuals. And Looper is a good example of that. There was hardly any [dialogue], you made sense of the movie through the visuals they gave you, There are also many scenes where the characters were speaking but what they said was cut.  now I can't read lips so this was more of a problem for me than anything.

The movie also repeated seems a lot. Sometimes this helped fill gaps in the plot. There was one scene, however, that at first was very dramatic. But later on, they played the same scene from a different [angle], farther away. The new [perspective] of the scene made it, I think, actually funny and not so dramatic.
