And Before You Ask, Yes, she was.

you’re in line at the grocery store

you check your phone to see the time

just to make sure you’re making good time for the bus

the wind blows your hair back slightly

you frisk it to see if it’s kept its shape

you notice out the corner of your eye that you’ve caught a woman’s attention

“why is she staring at me?” you wonder

you flash a polite smile and quickly look away, hoping she is satisfied with and ends this awkward experience

the line moves forward

you check your wallet and bank account app, making sure you have enough funds to

secure the groceries in your basket

the entrance sliding doors open once again, blowing your hair

the same woman has not released her gaze

it’s your turn in line

the employee kindly grabs your basket and begins to scan the items

you watch as the price goes up continuously, monitoring the transaction

the woman is now in front of you a register over

despite flashing another polite smile, her interest has not diminished

I LOVE YOUR HAIR she shouts.

you mutter thank y-

IS IT YOURS? IT’S YOURS RIGHT? she continues, her volume gaining the attention of shoppers around

you nod

I LOVE IT, IT’S SO BIG

you smile silently and direct your attention back to the employee

you apologize to them as you reach into your purse for your cash

you thank the employee before grabbing your bags and sitting near the exit to wait for your friends

you keep your head down and pull out your phone

a few minutes pass, your friends slowly making their way towards you

as you all leave, bags in hand, another woman approaches and smiles as she gets
closer

“I like your hair,,” she says

“Thank you,,” you respond as you pass each other

You and your friends begin to load the car
