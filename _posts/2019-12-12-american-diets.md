Modern [American]s have been criticized for decades about their [poor] [diets] and consequent [health] issues. The average [American] will eat food from [McDonald’s] at least once a week, and even when they don’t, the food they’re eating is likely not ideal. Disregarding the obvious candies and fried foods that are un[health]y treats around the world, [American]s are accustomed to processed foods that rarely resemble their “[real]” counterparts, such as powdered “cheese” with macaroni rather than [real], churned cheese. [Meat] is mass-produced; animals are stuffed into cages, pumped with steroids, and then blended together to create hamburgers. Even [orange juice], which is naturally one ingredient, is made from concentrate with added preservatives and dyes.

The movie *[Food Inc.]*, among other similar productions, presents this perfectly. It exposes businesses and their un[health]y and unethical production styles. It informs its audience of mistreatment of both animals and people associated with the business. It blames [American] [culture] and [capitalism] for causing money to become the driving force of what people eat.

[Poor]er families can only afford cheap meals from fast food places and are more likely to become un[health]ily obese. Companies want the [biggest] chicken that costs the least to grow, so they feed the animals unnatural grains and steroids. The low prices of low quality foods then make the prices of [organic], local, and natural foods seem expensive.

[American] food production laws must change in order to end this [culture], but big food companies [bribe] lawmakers to let them continue with their unethical practices. Not only is this issue detrimental to our country’s overall [health], it causes the United States to appear wholly uneducated about nutrition, and thus less respectable.
