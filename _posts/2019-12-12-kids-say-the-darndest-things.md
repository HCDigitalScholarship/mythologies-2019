A while back, I was tasked with observing a class of children to see how they interact with one another at the young ages of 3-4, writing as many interactions as I could with the goal of going unnoticed. Spoiler alert, I failed, but the kids were pretty interesting. Because they are obviously minors, all of their cute little names have been pseudonymized.

*NOTES BEGIN*

I immediately take a seat in the corner where there are no children present.

Karla comes behind my chair, ignores me and sets up a pet shop: “Pet shop everyone!”

No one answers.

4 girls are playing with each other whispering by the play kitchen across the room. They are pretending to make food.

Group of 4 boys recognize and build shape forms with legos

Girls are still playing house

Children like to be recognized- Karla shouts 3 more times “who wants a pet from the pet shop?!”

Teacher says “I would love a pet from the pet shop”

Four girls run over to Karla and take pets.

The boys are beginning to chant “we chop kittens”

This goes on for five more minutes

Karla says “I want to keep the dog because Sophie kept a dog”

Girls say “excuse me and please” when handing each other pets

They are told it is time to clean.

I feel like someone is touching me

I turn around and Karla is playing in my hair. She smiled at me when we made eye contact.

I try to ignore it but she is still fondling in my locs.

I stand up and turn in a circle. As I sit back down, there are three more little girls playing in my hair

“I like your hair!” Followed by a bunch of “yea it’s so pretty”

I say thank you and get up and walk away, moving into the snack room.

All the children sit. There is one boy at and all girls table and one girl at an all boys table.

Another table fills with the same girls that touched my hair.

Everyone waits patiently for their snack.

Everyone eats and talks with one another

The two outsiders are in an easy conversation with the opposite sex

Everyone starts getting ready to go outside.

“Boobies isn’t a bathroom word! My mommy has boobies!”

It is time to leave out the door
